These are our robot and attachment designs we have created for FLL. The designs are in Brick Link Studio (https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/main.page) format. 

The designs require additional parts beyond what comes in the two LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime and SPIKE™ Prime Expansion Sets.

We purchase extra parts primarily using LEGO’s Pick A Brick (https://www.lego.com/en-us/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick)  or BrickOwl (www.brickowl.com). Note that some parts from LEGO Pick A Brick come from Europe or Asia and could take 30+ days to arrive.

We recommend using Brick Architect's LEGO Parts Guide (https://brickarchitect.com/parts) to help FLL teams member better visual the set of potentially available parts.
