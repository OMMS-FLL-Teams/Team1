Pybricks Robot Library used by the team. This code was tested against Pybricks 3.6/3.6.1. We have tested it extensively with LEGO Spike Prime hubs.

The library supports various attachment configurations including a top/front combination (see our Gen 1, 2, and 3 robot designs) and with side-by-side attachments (see our Box Robot design). It is not restricted to those designs and  can be used with LEGO's Adanced Drive Base if you load the Pybricks firmware on the hub.

You will need to update the robot_library_config_rev#.py file file for your robot(s). Currently the code supports 3 robots but can be easily extended for more. The configuration of each robot can be different.
